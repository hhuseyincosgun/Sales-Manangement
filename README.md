# Sales Manangement Project

### Business Request

The goal of this project is to improve the Internet Sales Reports by transitioning from static reports to dynamic visual dashboards. These dashboards provide comprehensive insights into sales performance, focusing on:

- We need to improve our **internet sales reports** and want to move from static reports to **visual dashboards**.

- Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have **sold of what products**, to **which clients** and
how **it has been over time.**

- Seeing as each **sales person** works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be
able to **filter them also.**

- We measure our numbers against **budget** so I added that in a **spreadsheet** so we can compare our
values against performance.

- The budget is for 2021 and we usually look **2 years back** in time when we do analysis of sales.
